# Programming Assignment 2 and 3 

This Programming assignment goals:

1. Computing TFIDF of 1-grams for large documents on Hadoop Map-Reduce.

2. Computing TFIDF of 2-grams for large documents on Hadoop Map-Reduce.

3. Picking only top 15 TFIDF of 1-gram and 2-gram per document and contrasting the diferrences between these two. 

Will 2-gram TFIDF provides more information than 1-gram? Can it provide the details about what the document is? 

The answers to the above questions can be found by goining through the two Ipython Notebooks:

1. Solutions.ipnyb

2. Solutions_Part_Two.ipnyb
